    <string name="cleanser">CLEANSER - A facial cleanser is a skincare product used to remove make-up, dead skin cells, oil, dirt, and other types of pollutants from the skin, helping to keep pores clear and prevent skin conditions such as acne.
        Finding the best cleanser can be tough given there are so many options. Knowing the differences between them will help you choose the best products for your skin.

        Gel cleansers are clear with a gel-like consistency. Many have deep-cleaning and exfoliating properties—ideal for oily, acne-prone skin.

        Cream cleansers are usually thicker and can be moisturizing, cleansing without stripping skin of its natural oils—ideal for dry or sensitive skin.

        Foam cleansers are lightweight solutions creating a foamy lather when dispensed from a pump package. Foam cleansers are pleasant to use and remove excess oil as effectively as gel cleansers—ideal for combination skin.</string>
